In recent trend in world wide Lockdowns due to COVID19 outbreak, 

as Face Mask is became mandatory for everyone while roaming outside, 

approach of Deep Learning for Detecting Faces With and Without mask were a good trendy practice. 

- Dataset

Data contains 12000 images with 3 color channels (RGB).

- Problem Statement

  Create a Face Mask Detection model using Convolutional Neural Network and OpenCV.
